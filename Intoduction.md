# Introduction

## What is machine learning?
There are two definitions, on which is outdated and one which is more relevent.

First one is by Arthur Samuel:
>The Field of study tha gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

The second one is the more relevent one by Tom Mitchell
>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

### Example of Tom Mitchell's definition, playing checkers
* E - the experience for playing many games of checkers
* T - the task of playing checkers
* P - the probability that the program will win the next game
